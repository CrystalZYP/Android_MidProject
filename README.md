# 三国人物志
`2017/11/18`

A mid-term homework project of our android development class.
It's a e-dictionary of characters in the period of Three Kingdoms.

The functions are basic, just add, delete, edit and search. We also add some sound effect and widget.

This [UI](https://github.com/xmuSistone/ViewpagerTransition) is awesome, but he didn't provide a capsulated library for us to refer.  
So we cloned the project and made modifications on the original.
